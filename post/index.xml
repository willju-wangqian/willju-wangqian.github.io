      <description>Intro This is a short summary of how to add C source code into an R package. I wrote this a year ago as a course material summary (STAT 580) and believed that I would remember all the basic details forever. Obviously, I was wrong. So I’m not 100 percent sure about the following contents and can only hope that this is still helpful to, I don’t know, at least myself in the future :) Enjoy!</description>

      <description>cmpsR  The cmpsR package is an implementation of the Congruent Matching Profile Segments (CMPS) method (Chen et al. 2019). In general, it can be used for objective comparison of striated tool marks, but in our examples, we mainly use it for bullet signatures comparison. The CMPS score is expected to be large if two signatures are similar. So it can also be considered as a feature that measures the similarity of two bullet signatures.</description>
